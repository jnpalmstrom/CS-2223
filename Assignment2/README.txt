Purpose of Question 1:
  Implement one of the most efficient algorithms, namely quick sort.
  
Description:

  The program begins by initializing an array of 100 random integers within the range (1, 1000).
  Next, the program creates the partition for quick sort based off of the median. Finally, the 
  program outputs the sorted array to an output file named quicksort.txt.

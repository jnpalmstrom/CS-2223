Description:

  Question 1: Test the Order of Growth
    
    This program assumes an inpt size of 10,000 (denoted by N). The program contains functions for linear, quadratic, and cubic     functions. Each function takes one argument. Each of the functions starts from 0 and goes until it reaches N. To compare       the order of growth of each of the functions, each of the functions prints the elapsed time in milliseconds.
  
  Question 4: Variation of Binary Search
    
    A program for Binary Search except instead of choosing the middle element each time to compare with, it will choose the 1/3     element each time to compare with and then decide to move left or right. At the beginning of the program, a list is created     for storing all even numbers between 1 and 400 in ascending order. The program takes 1 argument, and it outputs whether K       is found or not; The number of comparisons done by the algorithm; and the position at which K is found.
